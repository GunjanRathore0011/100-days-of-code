# 🚀 Day 61 - July 21, 2025

Today I solved two interesting problems on LeetCode:

---

## 🧪 1. Container With Most Water (LeetCode 11)
**Problem Link:** [LeetCode 11](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

**Approach:**  
Used two pointers starting from both ends. Calculated the area between the two lines and moved the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward to try and find a potentially larger area.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int i=0;
        int j=height.size()-1;
        int maxA=0;
        while(i<j){
            int minH=min(height[i],height[j]);
            int amount= minH * (j-i);
            maxA=max(maxA,amount);
            if(height[i]>=height[j]) j--;
            else i++;
        }
        return maxA;
    }
};
```

## ✅ 2. Check Divisibility by Digit Sum and Product
**Approach:**  
Calculated the digit sum and product of the number. Checked if the number is divisible by the sum of both.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool checkDivisibility(int n) {
        int dsum=0;
        int dProd=1;
        int num=n;
        while(n>0){
            dsum+=(n%10);
            dProd*=(n%10);
            n=n/10;
        }
        if((num%(dsum+dProd)==0) )return true;
        return false;
    }
};
```
