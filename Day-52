# Day 52 of #100DaysOfCode

Today was tough â€” mentally and physically. I felt completely exhausted.

Still, I made the decision to **not break the streak** and solved an easy problem to keep going. Iâ€™ll bounce back stronger tomorrow ðŸ’ª

## âœ… Problem Solved:

### [58. Length of Last Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word)

### Approach:
- Start from the end of the string and skip trailing spaces.
- Count characters until the next space is encountered.
- Return the length of the last word.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int i = s.size() - 1;

        while (i >= 0 && s[i] == ' ') {
            i--;
        }

        int length = 0;
        while (i >= 0 && s[i] != ' ') {
            length++;
            i--;
        }

        return length;
    }
};
```

Sometimes, no matter how well you plan your day, energy just doesnâ€™t show up. Itâ€™s okay. The important thing is **to not quit**.
